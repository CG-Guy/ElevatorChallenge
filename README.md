# Elevator Control System

## Overview
The Elevator Control System is a console application designed to simulate the movement of elevators within a large building. This application optimizes passenger transportation while adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## Features
- **Real-Time Elevator Status**: Displays the current status of each elevator, including its floor, direction of movement, motion state, and number of passengers.
- **Interactive Elevator Control**: Allows users to request an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers.
- **Multiple Floors and Elevators Support**: Designed to handle multiple floors and elevators, facilitating efficient movement between different floors.
- **Efficient Elevator Dispatching**: Implements an algorithm to direct the nearest available elevator to respond to requests, minimizing wait times for passengers.
- **Passenger Limit Handling**: Enforces maximum passenger limits for elevators and manages scenarios requiring additional elevators.
- **Future Extensions**: The architecture is designed to accommodate additional elevator types such as high-speed and freight elevators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version required by the project)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ElevatorChallenge.git

2. cd ElevatorChallenge

3. dotnet restore

4. dotnet run


Usage
Upon starting the application, you will see the current status of all elevators.
Enter the floor number to request an elevator (between 0 and 5).
